# URL Shortener
This is a generic version of a URL shortener I had written for ChandlerBlvd in 2014, when short URLs were a big deal.

# How it works
A privileged user can sign in and paste a URL into a form. When the form is submitted, a short string is generated. 
When an HTTP request is made for `thisdomain.com/[short string]`, the response is a redirect to the original URL.
This enables short URLs to be used in social systems where character counts matter.
This also provides a way to track click-throughs.
